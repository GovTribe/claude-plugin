# Team On An Opportunity

Use the section matching the requested action. For broader partner research, use [Likely Bidders](likely-bidders.md) and [Past Performance Match](past-performance-match.md).

## 1. Resolve the target and existing interest

Reuse the resolved target or a pursuit's linked record from [Search_Pursuits](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-pursuits-mcp-tool). Resolve contract opportunities with [Search_Federal_Contract_Opportunities](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-federal-contract-opportunities-mcp-tool), grants with [Search_Federal_Grant_Opportunities](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-federal-grant-opportunities-mcp-tool), or an unclear record type with [Search_GovTribe](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-govtribe-mcp-tool).

Opportunity teaming uses `federal_meta_opportunity_id`; IDVs, vehicles, forecasts and awards use their own `govtribe_id`. Grant search currently omits the wrapper ID; use a verified wrapper if already available, otherwise report the missing lookup.

Use [Search_Teaming_Interests](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-teaming-interests-mcp-tool) without `teamable_ids` to find your own interests, including hidden/withdrawn ones. Request `teamable`, `intent`, `status` and `intakeQuestions` alongside IDs; reuse the matching interest.

## 2. Discover compatible interests

Search with `teamable_ids` and the complementary `teaming_interest_intents` (`prime` or `sub`). Request `govtribe_id`, `govtribe_url`, `name`, `govtribe_ai_summary`, `can_request_match` and `match_state_for_viewer`; reuse existing matches.

Discovery hides other companies' vendor identities and intake answers. For a named partner, use their known interest ID/link. Accepted matches expose identity through `viewer_context`, rather than the nested counterparty `vendor` field.

## 3. Create or update your interest

Resolve the represented company with [Search_Vendors](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-vendors-mcp-tool). An existing vendor record is required; claiming its profile is not.

Reuse known answers and ask for missing intake:

- **Prime:** `capture_stage`, `sub_workshare_expectations`.
- **Sub:** `role_and_workshare`, `relevant_experience`; add capacity, location or preferences when useful.

Use [Create_Teaming_Interest](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-teaming-interest-mcp-tool) for a new interest or [Update_Teaming_Interest](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-teaming-interest-mcp-tool) for name, intake or tags. Intake/tag updates replace the entire set; include all answers/tags to retain. Intent, vendor and target cannot be changed through Update.

## 4. Request matches and use conversations

Use [Request_Teaming_Match](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/request-teaming-match-mcp-tool) with your existing open interest, or [Create_Interest_And_Request_Match](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-interest-and-request-match-mcp-tool) when creating your interest and approaching a selected partner together. Both sides need the same target and opposite intents.

Find inbound requests with [Search_Teaming_Matches](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-teaming-matches-mcp-tool), `my_pending_inbound: true`. Request `govtribe_id`, `govtribe_url`, `status`, `viewer_context`, `prime_teaming_interest` and `sub_teaming_interest`. Use [Respond_To_Teaming_Match](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/respond-to-teaming-match-mcp-tool) to accept or decline. Acceptance reveals company identity and declines the sub interest's other pending matches. Decline prevents that requester from requesting the same target interest again.

Read with [Get_Teaming_Messages](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/get-teaming-messages-mcp-tool); search topics across an interest's conversations with [Search_Teaming_Messages](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-teaming-messages-mcp-tool). Clarifying messages can precede acceptance. [Send_Teaming_Message](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/send-teaming-message-mcp-tool) sends the user's approved text and notifies participants. Use `teaming_match_id` for a match conversation or the prime's `teaming_interest_id` for the team hub.

## 5. Manage interests and teams

| Action | Tool and effect |
| --- | --- |
| Pause discovery | [Hide_Teaming_Interest](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/hide-teaming-interest-mcp-tool) hides an open interest; existing matches remain. |
| Resume discovery | [Reopen_Teaming_Interest](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/reopen-teaming-interest-mcp-tool) reopens hidden/withdrawn interests; cancelled matches stay cancelled. |
| Withdraw an interest | [Withdraw_Teaming_Interest](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/withdraw-teaming-interest-mcp-tool) cancels its pending matches. |
| Cancel or leave a match | [Withdraw_Teaming_Match](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/withdraw-teaming-match-mcp-tool): requester cancels a pending request; either participant can leave an accepted match. |
| Finalize a team | [Lock_In_Teaming_Team](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/lock-in-teaming-team-mcp-tool): prime with accepted partners opens the hub and withdraws all pending matches on that prime interest. |
| End a team | [Disband_Teaming_Team](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/disband-teaming-team-mcp-tool) ends accepted and pending matches, withdraws the prime and closes the hub; subs return to open. |
| Record feedback | [Submit_Teaming_Match_Feedback](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/submit-teaming-match-feedback-mcp-tool) records private account feedback, replacing that account's prior feedback. |
