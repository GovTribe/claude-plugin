# Manage Pipelines and Pursuits

Use pipelines for capture workflows and pursuits for individual pieces of business. Apply the sections needed for the request.

## 1. Create or update a pipeline

Find pipelines with [Search_Pipelines](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-pipelines-mcp-tool). Use one pipeline per team/process; separate pipelines when workflows differ. Use tags for agency, fiscal year or prime/sub role.

Adapt this starting structure:

| Stage | Work to manage |
| --- | --- |
| Triage | Screen new leads for basic fit and decide which deserve research. |
| Qualification | Establish eligibility, buyer need, relevant experience and a credible route to compete. |
| Capture | Develop customer knowledge, competitive position, partners, solution and pricing; decide whether to invest in a proposal. |
| Proposal | Assign requirements, prepare and review the response, and meet the submission deadline. |
| Submitted | Track receipt, amendments, discussions and the award decision. |

For a new pipeline, [Create_Pipeline](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-pipeline-mcp-tool) requires `name` and `stageCount`, with optional `description`. This example needs four user stages; Triage, Won, Lost and Abandoned are automatic. Retrieve IDs, names and `type` with [Search_Stages](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-stages-mcp-tool), filtered by `pipeline_ids`. Rename using [Update_Stage](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-stage-mcp-tool), passing `pursuit_index_map: []` to preserve pursuit order; use [Create_Stage](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-stage-mcp-tool) for additions. Retain useful existing stages. [Update_Pipeline](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-pipeline-mcp-tool) requires `name`, including for description-only changes.

## 2. Build a useful pursuit record

Find contracts, grants and forecasts through [Relevant Opportunities](relevant-opportunities.md). Use [Search_Pursuits](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-pursuits-mcp-tool), using `pipeline_ids` and `fields_to_return` for IDs, name, stage, owner, associated records and relevant planning fields. Check linked records and scope, including closed pursuits; keep a forecast and its solicitation in the same pursuit.

[Create_Pursuit](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-pursuit-mcp-tool) takes `stage_id` plus `linked_item_id`/`linked_item_model_class`, or `name` for an unlinked lead. Inspect auto-filled fields. [Update_Pursuit](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-pursuit-mcp-tool) changes the description, stage and planning fields:

- Record the buyer's need, why the work fits, intended role, competitors, partners and unresolved questions.
- Keep the response deadline, expected award date and `estimated_duration` in months current. Put internal milestones on tasks.
- Explain the `estimated_value` basis in whole USD dollars, including subcontract workshare. A vehicle ceiling is not expected revenue. Set `pwin` (0–100) from the team's assessment of win prospects.

Give each pursuit an accountable owner. Owner changes and adding related records to an existing pursuit use the [pursuit page](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-user-guide/capture/pursuits); the MCP update tool does not expose them.

## 3. Turn capture work into assigned actions

Use [Bid / No-Bid Review](conduct-bid-no-bid-review.md) for qualification decisions and `govtribe-proposal-workflows` for requested response preparation; use [Likely Bidders](likely-bidders.md), [Teaming](team-on-an-opportunity.md) and [Past Performance Match](past-performance-match.md) for specific research. Record the decision and reasoning in the pursuit description or a [Create_Pursuit_Discussion](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-pursuit-discussion-mcp-tool).

Make each active pursuit's next action concrete: confirm vehicle access, validate a past-performance reference, settle partner workshare or review an amendment. Resolve existing actions with [Search_Tasks](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-tasks-mcp-tool) and teammates with [Search_Users](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-users-mcp-tool). [Create_Task](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/create-task-mcp-tool) requires `pipeline_id`, `pursuit_id`, `owner_model_id`, `name` and `due_date`; [Update_Task](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-task-mcp-tool) requires the task, pipeline and pursuit IDs. Reuse tasks for continuing work. Task completion uses the [Tasks interface](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-user-guide/capture/tasks); MCP does not expose it.

Use [Search_Tags](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-tags-mcp-tool) for filtering and [Search_Custom_Field_Definitions](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-custom-field-definitions-mcp-tool) for recurring structured information. `tag_ids` replaces the full set; preserve existing tags. `custom_fields` updates named `custom_field_id`/`value` entries; `null` clears a value. Find saved files with [Search_User_Files](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/search-user-files-mcp-tool) and associate them using [Update_User_File](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/update-user-file-mcp-tool); a file links to one pursuit.

## 4. Review progress and retain outcomes

Review active work weekly or at the team's cadence, and after material buyer changes. Use [Review My Pipeline](review-my-pipeline.md) to identify stale dates, missing next actions and unrealistic estimates. Move pursuits when the work supports the next stage; recheck the bid decision when scope, eligibility or resources change. [Saved searches](relevant-opportunities.md#5-set-up-recurring-checks) supply new leads for Triage.

Use the actual Won, Lost or Abandoned stage with `Update_Pursuit`. Record the reason and lessons: Won for a confirmed win, Lost for an unsuccessful submitted response, Abandoned for work the team stops pursuing or a canceled procurement. An elapsed deadline alone does not establish an outcome. Keep closed records for future qualification and lessons learned.

For requested cleanup, [deleting a stage](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/delete-stage-mcp-tool) or [pipeline](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/delete-pipeline-mcp-tool) removes contained pursuits; [deleting a pursuit](https://govtribe.com/docs/govtribe-for-agents/tools/delete-pursuit-mcp-tool) removes its discussions, tasks and associated user-file records. Move work that must remain before deleting its stage. Inspect results, retain completed changes after partial success, and summarize remaining actions.
