# GovTribe File Templates

## Template routes

Choose the guide matching the requested deliverable; continue a supplied form or selected working file without reselecting a library template.

- **Responses and buyer forms:** [RFI / Sources Sought](references/rfi-sources-sought-response.md), [RFQ Quotation](references/rfq-quotation-response.md), [Proposal Response](references/proposal-response.md), [Past Performance Narrative](references/past-performance-project-narrative.md), or [complete the buyer's original form](references/template-adaptation-and-revisions.md).
- **Compliance and response planning:** [Compliance Matrix](references/proposal-control-workbook.md) or [Annotated Proposal Outline](references/annotated-proposal-outline.md).
- **Capture decisions and briefings:** [Opportunity Brief](references/opportunity-capture-brief.md), [Bid / No-Bid Assessment](references/bid-no-bid-assessment.md), [Executive Capture Briefing](references/executive-capture-briefing.md), or [Teaming Partner Shortlist](references/teaming-partner-shortlist.md).
- **Company and market analysis:** [Company Profile / Due Diligence](references/company-profile.md), [Contract Awards and Spend Analysis](references/contract-awards-spend-analysis.md), or [System / Program Research](references/system-program-research.md).
- **Pricing and pipeline workbooks:** [Labor Pricing and Staffing](references/labor-pricing-staffing-model.md) or [Opportunity Pipeline Tracker](references/opportunity-pipeline-tracker.md).

Use `govtribe-govcon-writing` for narrative and capability statements; a company due-diligence report serves a different purpose.

## Select, adapt and check

1. **Select the starting file.** Required buyer forms take precedence. For a new library file, match the requested name, ID or deliverable in `assets/catalog.json`, then run `python3 scripts/resolve_template.py TEMPLATE_ID` from this skill's root. Verify the selected revision and copy its blank master; examples are illustrative. Exact-version selection and non-Python verification are covered in the supporting reference below.
2. **Adapt the selected file.** Read its completion guide and use the catalog's `domain_skill` for needed research, resolving resources from each skill's installed root. Reuse existing requirements, company evidence and accepted edits. Use native document, spreadsheet or presentation capabilities; preserve formulas and editable elements. Tailor content to the government buyer, internal capture team or prospective partner.
3. **Check the saved deliverable.** Reconcile sources, dates and calculations; recalculate workbook formulas and summary totals before rendering. Inspect the saved pages, affected sheets or slides using the adaptation checks below. Retain the editable source and matching exports. If native authoring is unavailable, provide useful Markdown, CSV or a slide outline and identify remaining file work.
